# Sanctified-Retribution

  Although millions of years have passed due to him being sealed in hell forever,
Metesis, whose anger, hatred and hatred have grown even more, needs outside
help to achieve this. In order to achieve this, he agrees with Osuiris and
Sarkanous, the brothers of Metesis, and planned to come to earth as a result of
the sacrifice of an entire village of believers and innocents on earth.
Unfortunately, he has also succeeded in this plan, but he is unaware of the
existence of a person who, like him, cannot remain silent about this situation and
is dedicated to the creator, who will try every way for revenge. The main
character (the Struggler), who has not lost his faith despite all the bad and ugly
events that have happened in the world before, has completely lost his mind as a
result of this situation. Although the Creator has always known of the Struggler's
faith and devotion to him, he regretted ignoring it at the time and decided to help
him indirectly, as he likened the Struggler to Metesis, his first created being. The
struggler will both fight his battle within himself and direct all the anger that has
accumulated within him to those who caused it...
